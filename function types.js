/*
Global Scope: Named functions are hoisted, 
meaning they can be called before they are defined in the code. 
This makes them ideal for utility functions that need to be available throughout the code.
Named for Clarity: The function name (addFive) makes it easy to identify in code and during debugging.

Readable and Traditional: This is the most traditional way to define a function, making it highly readable, 
especially for beginners or in teams that prefer a more conventional style.

Named Function: The function is named addFive, making it easy to identify in stack traces when debugging.

/*
Use Case:

    Encapsulation: Like other function expressions, this one is not hoisted,
     so it is only available after it is defined in the code.
    Named Function Expression: The function addFiveFunction has a name,
     which can be helpful for debugging, especially when it appears in stack traces. 
     However, the function is still assigned to the variable addFive, so itâ€™s called using that variable.
    Reassignable: Function expressions can be reassigned if needed.



    Encapsulation: Function expressions are not hoisted, so they are defined at runtime. This is useful when you want to ensure that a function is only available
    after a certain point in the code, often for better encapsulation.

    Anonymous Functions: You can create anonymous functions, which can be useful in callbacks,
    event listeners, or immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs).
    
    Flexibility: Function expressions can be used in places where you need a
    function that might be reassigned later or when you want to pass a function as an argument.

    Context-Specific Behavior: You might want a function to behave differently based on certain conditions,

    you can easily switch its behavior without rewriting large portions of code.


    In this example, the calculateDiscount function is reassigned based on whether the user is a member or not,

/*
Use Case:

    Concise Syntax: Arrow functions offer a more concise way to write functions, which is useful for small, inline functions.

    Lexical this: Arrow functions inherit the this value from their surrounding context, 
    making them particularly useful in scenarios where maintaining the this context is important, such as in callbacks.

Named Function (calculateTotalPrice):

    This function takes the prices of three items as arguments and returns their sum.

Function Expression (applyDiscount):

    This function expression takes the total price and a discount percentage as arguments.
    It calculates the discounted price by subtracting the discount amount from the total price.

Arrow Function (addTax):

    This arrow function takes the discounted amount and a tax rate as arguments.
